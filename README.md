🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in data analysis, where we explore, visualize, and summarize datasets to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies. It helps in understanding the structure of data before applying machine learning models or making business decisions.

📌 Key EDA Techniques:
✔ Handling Missing Values – Identifying and treating NaN values
✔ Data Cleaning & Transformation – Removing duplicates, correcting data types
✔ Statistical Summary – Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
✔ Data Visualization – Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps
✔ Correlation Analysis – Understanding relationships between variables

📊 Power BI for Data Analysis & Visualization:
Power BI is a business intelligence tool that helps in creating interactive dashboards and reports from data sources. It enables users to visualize data, derive insights, and make data-driven decisions with ease.

🔥 Features of Power BI:
✔ Data Import & Transformation – Connects with databases, Excel, APIs, and more
✔ Drag-and-Drop Visualizations – Bar charts, line graphs, maps, KPIs, etc.
✔ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for advanced calculations
✔ Real-Time Data Processing – Helps in dynamic reporting
✔ AI-Powered Insights – Smart analysis for trends & anomalies
